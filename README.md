# SwiftUIRouting

A SwiftUI Routing solution inspired by the article [Routing in SwiftUI](https://betterprogramming.pub/routing-in-swiftui-1dc87b7a47c7) by Ihor Vovk

I wanted to create this repository to keep track of a working solution of Routing in SwiftUI which covers:
- NavigationLink (Push)
- Sheet (Modal)
- Top
- Swap

I'll try to extend this solution to support:
- Matching Geometry Effect for swap navigations
- More modifiers to specify custom transitions and animations.


Contributions and Ideas are really appreciated :)
